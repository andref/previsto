# Previsto: A Markdown preview app

Instead of fiddling with your favorite text editor to
make it preview [Markdown][1] files, use this app. Just 
drop any markdown file on the Previsto Window.

## Features

Previsto is meant to be simple. Here is the feature
list to prove it:

- Preview updates when the file is saved.
- Drag files from any program into the window to preview.
- Open Markdown files from nautilus using the context menu.

## Dependencies

Previsto is a [Qt][2] app and needs Qt version 4.6 or later
to build.

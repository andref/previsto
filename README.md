# Previsto -- A Markdown preview app

Instead of fiddling with your favorite text editor to
make it preview markdown files, use this app. Just 
drop any markdown file on the Previsto Window.

## Missing Features

Soon to come, however.

- Error handling!
- Handle links externally, because we're not a web browser...
- Feedback on drag-and-drop.
- Create a package for the latest Ubuntu version
- Improve the default ugly stylesheet
- Allow multiple stylesheets (via drag and drop?)
- Save to HTML/PDF?
- Allow dropping text/simple
